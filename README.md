**Hyperparameter Tuning Using Quantum Evolutionary Algorithms: A Case Study on Persian Language Number Plate Recognition**

Hyperparameter tuning is a crucial step in machine learning, but it can be very time-consuming and computationally expensive. Traditional methods like grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization often struggle with high-dimensional search spaces, slow convergence, and inefficiency. To address these challenges, we developed a Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Algorithm (QEA) for efficient hyperparameter tuning. We applied this approach to a complex task: Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) for Persian language numbers.

### **Background and Motivation**
Hyperparameter tuning is essential for optimizing machine learning models, but classical methods have limitations. They often get stuck in local optima or take too long to find good solutions. Quantum-inspired optimization, on the other hand, leverages principles like superposition, entanglement, and parallelism to explore the search space more efficiently. ANPR is a challenging task that requires precise hyperparameter tuning, making it an ideal application for testing the QEA.

### **Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Algorithm (QEA)**
The QEA uses quantum principles to improve the search for optimal hyperparameters. Here’s how it works:
1. **Quantum Representation**: Individuals in the population are represented as qubits in superposition, allowing them to explore multiple states simultaneously.
2. **Quantum-Inspired Operations**: Crossover and mutation are inspired by quantum mechanics. For example, quantum-inspired crossover uses superposition and entanglement to combine solutions, while quantum-inspired mutation explores a wider range of potential solutions.
3. **Measurement**: Quantum states are measured and collapsed into classical states, which are then decoded into hyperparameters.

### **Advantages of QEA**
The QEA offers several benefits:
- Efficient exploration of the search space.
- Faster convergence to better solutions compared to classical methods.

### **Methodology**
The QEA follows these steps:
1. **Define Hyperparameters**: Key hyperparameters like learning rate, number of layers, and batch size are identified.
2. **Quantum Representation**: Individuals are represented as quantum circuits.
3. **Measurement and Decoding**: Quantum states are measured and decoded into hyperparameters.
4. **Fitness Evaluation**: The fitness of each solution is evaluated using the ANPR model’s validation accuracy.
5. **Iteration**: The process is repeated over multiple generations to find the optimal hyperparameters.

### **Implementation**
We used the following tools and setup:
- **Quantum Simulation**: Qiskit/Pennylane for simulating quantum circuits.
- **ANPR Model**: TensorFlow/Keras for building the ANPR model.
- **Dataset**: A standard ANPR dataset for Persian numbers.
- **Experimental Setup**: Population size of 10, 5 generations, and hyperparameter ranges for learning rate (0.0001–0.01), layers (1–5), and batch size (16–128).

### **Results**
The QEA showed promising results:
- **Convergence Plot**: The model’s accuracy improved steadily over generations, plateauing around generation 15. This indicates effective exploration and convergence.
- **Optimized Hyperparameters**: The best learning rate was 0.045, and the best number of units in the hidden layer was 75.
- **Comparison with Classical EA**: The QEA outperformed a classical evolutionary algorithm, achieving faster convergence and higher accuracy.
- **Final Model Performance**: After tuning, the model achieved 96.00% accuracy and a 4.00% error rate on the validation set.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Most predictions were correct, with misclassifications being minimal.

### **Discussion**
The QEA demonstrated clear advantages, including higher accuracy and faster convergence. However, it also has limitations, such as simulation overhead on classical hardware and the need for quantum hardware to fully realize its potential. Future work could explore integrating QEA with neuromorphic computing or reinforcement learning and applying it to other machine learning tasks.

### **Conclusion**
The Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Algorithm is a powerful tool for hyperparameter tuning. It outperforms classical methods in accuracy, convergence, and efficiency, making it particularly useful for complex tasks like ANPR. This work paves the way for broader applications of quantum-inspired optimization in machine learning.
